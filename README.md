## Book Management Full-Stack Application
# Overview
This application allows users to manage a collection of books with features such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting books (CRUD). It uses Node.js for the backend API, MongoDB for data storage, Elasticsearch for advanced search functionality, and React for the frontend user interface.

# Project Structure
Backend: Built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch
Frontend: Built with React.js for a dynamic, user-friendly interface

# Requirements
Node.js (Backend)
MongoDB (Database for storing book data)
Elasticsearch (Search engine for advanced book search functionality)
React.js (Frontend user interface)
API Endpoints

Here is a brief overview of the backend API routes for managing books:

Create a new book Route: POST /api/books Body: { "title": "Book Title", "author": "Author Name", "publicationYear": 2020, "isbn": "1234567890", "description": "Book description" }

Retrieve all books Route: GET /api/books Response: [ { "title": "Book Title", "author": "Author Name", "publicationYear": 2020, "isbn": "1234567890", "description": "Book description" }, ]

Retrieve a single book by ID Route: GET /api/books/:id Response: { "id": "1", "title": "Book Title", "author": "Author Name", "publicationYear": 2020, "isbn": "1234567890", "description": "Book description" }

Update a book by ID Route: PUT /api/books/:id Body: { "title": "Updated Book Title", "author": "Updated Author", "publicationYear": 2021, "isbn": "0987654321", "description": "Updated book description" }

Delete a book by ID Route: DELETE /api/books/:id Response: { "message": "Book deleted successfully" }

Search for books Route: GET /api/search Query Params: q (search query) Response: [ { "id": "1", "title": "Book Title", "author": "Author Name", "publicationYear": 2020, "isbn": "1234567890", "description": "Book description" }, ... ]

# Technologies Used
